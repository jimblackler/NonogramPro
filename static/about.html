<main><p><b>Nonograms</b> are a type of puzzle invented in 1987 by Non Ishida and independently by Tetsuya
  Nishio. They are also known as Picross puzzles and other names. The objective is to complete an
  image made by shading cells in a grid from clues given for each row and column.</p>
  <p>It can take a little while to learn the solving techniques. A good summary can be found on
    Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram#Example">here</a></p>
  <p><b>Nonogram Pro</b> is a website to play Nonograms developed by myself, Jim Blackler, in 2022.</p>
  <p>It includes a number of puzzles generated from a number of Creative Commons or public domain
    image collections.</p>
  <p>To get started, click on a puzzle from the grid of available puzzles to play. The empty grid
    with the clues will be shown. Puzzles are completed using the mouse or trackpad. To shade a
    cell, left-click on an empty cell. To mark a cell as definitely empty, left-click again on a
    shaded cell. Alternatively, to mark a cell as empty, right-click with the mouse, or hold down
    the shift key and left click.</p>
  <p>If the user shades a cell such that the grid could not possibly fit the clues, the relevant
    part of the clue will be shown in red. Note that this does not mean that if the clue is not
    shown in red that no mistake has been made by the player.</p>
  <p>You can also create your own puzzles by clicking ‘Design a game’ and using the editor to paint
    the completed grid. You can play games you’ve created in your browser, or publish them on the
    website after signing in with a Google account. You may then share puzzles with friends via a
    link to the play page.</p>
  <p>For any questions feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:jimblackler@gmail.com">jimblackler@gmail.com</a>.
    If you make any games you’re particularly proud of, send me a link, and I’ll consider adding
    them to the collection of games shown to all players.</p></main>
